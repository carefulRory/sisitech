## Automarketing Marketing Insights

- In marketing, the customer lifetime value is the total worth to a business of the customer over the whole period of their relationship. Top companies such as 
Meta have implemented and allowed advertisers to incorporate customer lifetime value in their marketing campaigns.

- According to Meta, customer lifetime value is a numeric representation of the net profit you predict will be attributable to a given customer over the duration of your relationship with them. You can break it down into a few factors:

            - 🎟️ :How often a customer makes a purchase within a typical purchase cycle
            - 🎟️ :How much a customer spends each time they make a purchase
            - 🎟️ :The potential length of a customer's relationship with you

- For Wavvy Wallet, we can provide our customers with intelligent insights by automatically calculating the lifetime value of each of their clients. We can do this by using a simple formula basing on the MPESA sms message history.

           - 🎟️ :Number of MPESA messages from same number
           - 🎟️ :Total amount received from same number
           - 🎟️ :Date of latest transaction
           - 🎟️ :Date of first imported transaction
           - 🎟️ :Lifetime = (Date of first imported transaction - Date of latest transaction) in days
           - 🎟️ :CLV = (Lifetime x Amount Spent) / X

- Example of customer report with CLV.
