# CRYPTO WALLETS

A crypto wallet is used to interact with a blockchain network.

In reality, crypto wallets don’t store the currency but act as a tool of interaction with blockchain, i.e., generating the necessary information to receive and send money via blockchain transactions.

## How do crypto wallets work?

Crypto wallet uses public and private key cryptography to give you access to your cryptoassets.

The *public key* enables others to send cryptoassets to you, while the *private key* gives you the ownership to spend it. All these mechanisms happen in the background, and the only thing you need to ensure is the [safety of seed words](https://coinsutra.com/keep-recovery-seed-safe-secure/), which you get while setting up your crypto wallet for the first time.

## Wallets criteria

## Wallet Categories

### Hot Wallets

 Hot wallets are connected to the Internet and thus are less secure and pose more risks but are user friendly.

They are more likely to be used for daily transactions since :

- They are easy to set up
- The funds are quickly accessible.
- Traders conveniently use them.

### Cold wallets

 They are are stored offline and don’t require internet connectivity thus they have improved security and less risk.
 They are used  for more long-term holdings hence are suitable for HODLers.

## Types of wallets

 They are often referred to as *cold storage*.
 Examples of such devices are:

- Trezor - [Trezor](https://shop.trezor.io/)

### Web wallets

Web wallets are hot wallets that are always connected to the internet and can be accessed via different internet browsers.
A simple example of the web wallet is storing cryptocurrencies on a crypto exchange. The most important thing you need to know here is, you don’t have access to your crypto wallet’s private key.

Web wallets are sometimes hosted wallets (no access to private key) and sometimes non-hosted (control over private key/seed word) too, depending on what type of wallet you are using. However, we always recommend using “non-hosted wallets” so that you always control your funds.

## Custodial Wallets

A custodial crypto wallet is one where your assets are held in custody for you.

This means a third party will hold and manage your private keys on your behalf. In other words, you won't have full control over your funds - nor the ability to sign transactions.

## Non-custodial wallets

A non-custodial crypto wallet is a wallet where only the holder possesses and controls the private keys.

For users who want full control over their funds, non-custodial wallets are the best option. Since there are no intermediaries, you can trade crypto directly from your wallets.

It's a good option for experienced traders and investors, who know how to manage and protect their private keys and seed phrases.

You will need a non-custodial wallet when interacting with a decentralized exchange ([DEX](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-a-decentralized-exchange-dex)) or decentralized application ([DApp](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/decentralized-application)).  

Examples of decentralized exchanges that require a non-custodial wallets are:

- Uniswap [uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)
- SushiSwap [sushi](https://www.sushi.com/)
- PancakeSwap [guide](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/a-guide-to-pancakeswap)
- QuickSwa
