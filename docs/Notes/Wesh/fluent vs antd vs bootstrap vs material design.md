# Design Philosophies

## Fluent

Fluent is an open-source, cross-platform design system that gives designers and developers the frameworks they need to create engaging product experiencesâ€”accessibility, internationalization, and performance included.

## Fluent for Web

Microsoft's Fluent UI Web Components are designed to help you build Fluent web apps using extensible Web Components. he package composes the @microsoft/fast-foundation Web Component package and styles it with the Fluent design language.

With Fluent UI Web Components you can:

- Build a modern, standards-based, highly performant, highly accessible web front-end
- Build a web front end using only web platform code, no other frameworks, or
- Integrate with many popular frameworks like .NET, Blazor, Vue, React, etc.
- Build a web-standards UX built with W3C Web Component standards
- Leverage the existing Fluent UI design language as design tokens
- Customize the design language for your project by modifying and creating new design tokens
- Use the components out-of-the-box to build your web user experience or
- Customize, compose and build new Web Components based on the libraries that Fluent UI Web Components is built on, FAST
- Be part of a dynamic, open-web development community

## Fluent for Windows

### WinUI 3

WinUI is a user interface layer that contains native controls and styles for building Windows apps. It embodies Fluent Design, giving each Windows app the polished feel that customers expect.

### Fluent UI React Native

Fluent UI React Native is an open-source library built with JavaScript and React Native components. Use it to create Fluent experiences that work across Windows and across other platforms. It contains information about colors and typography, as well as custom controls and customizations

## Fluent for iOS

Uses Fluent UI Apple which offers customizations and custom controls that deliver unique Fluent experiences to customers using iOS devices.

### Controls

Fluent UI iOS includes an expanding library of controls written in Swift and supporting Objective-C. These controls implement the Fluent Design language and provide consistency across Microsoft experiences.

## Fluent for Android

Uses Fluent UI Android which offers customizations and custom controls that deliver unique Fluent experiences to customers using Android devices.

### Controls for Android

Fluent UI Android includes an expanding library of controls written in Kotlin. These controls implement the Fluent design language and bring consistency across Microsoft app experiences.

## Fluent for macOS

Uses Fluent UI Apple which offers customizations and custom controls that deliver unique Fluent experiences to customers using macOS devices.

### Controls for macOS

Fluent UI macOS includes an expanding library of controls written in Swift and supporting Objective-C. These controls implement the Fluent Design language and provide consistency across Microsoft experiences.

## Fluent for cross-platform

Fluent UI React Native includes an expanding library of controls written in JavaScript. These controls implement the Fluent Design language and provide consistency across Microsoft experiences.

FluentUI React Native is still in the alpha stages of development for both the components and the repo.i.e.
| Windows             | macOS               | iOS                 | Android     |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Alpha (in progress) | Alpha (in progress) | Alpha (in progress) | Coming Soon |
