# Headless CMS

## **What is Headless CMS?**

Headless CMS is a content management system that separates where content is stored (the “body”) from where it is presented (the “head“). You can store the content in your headless CMS and then send it to display anywhere – offering a lot more flexibility as to how it's presented in different places.

## **How does a Headless CMS work?**
Headless CMS works by:

1. Giving editors an interface for managing content.
2. Providing that content via APIs for developers to query and build applications with.

Most headless CMSes are offered as a Software as a Service (SaaS), meaning that your editors will have to log into a web application and that the APIs are hosted in a cloud-based backend. 

To use a headless CMS, you have to build a website or an application first, then use the CMS's API to query and serve your content into it. This is in contrast to “creating your content on the website” as in the case of page builders and classic Web CMS.
