## Initial Sign Up Use Case
- Account Creation should be seperated from the Sign Up process
- The first time Account Creation happens should be when importing mpesa messages after signing up.
- The user flow should be : On board screens ➡️ Sign Up Pages ➡️ Import Messages Page ➡️ Account Creation Page ➡️ Home Page

## Import Messages Use Case
- Importing Mpesa messages should allow options on the date range from which mpesa messages should be imported. E.g Last one month, Last three months, Last one year
- Importing messages should be able to happen in the background once allowed regardless of which screen is active or if app is terminated.
- Immediately after allowing the import, the first time user should be taken through Account Creation while importing happens in the background.
- There should be progress indicators showing the importation progress on the Home Page in case user is redirected there before importing is done.
- There should be a default view for a user who doesn't allow importing messages.
- Automatic tagging of messages should happen in the API. The API should then return a list of tagged transactions on the Home Page
- Tagging the associated account for each transaction is left to the user

## Account Creation Use Case
- A wallet is an entity relating to a specific type of transactions e.g. Mpesa Wallet (mpesa transactions), Equity Wallet(equity transactions), MasterCard Wallet e.t.c. 
- An account on the other hand, is a variation of a single wallet, basically different intereprtataions/classifications of that wallet's transactions. For example, Mpesa Wallet can have 3 accounts : Personal Account, Business Account and Contributions Account.
- The Contributions name should be renamed to Chama account as it's more descriptive
- Account Creation should entail :
  1. Choosing the type of account (one account at a time)
  2. Filling a form with details of the account to be created
  3. Tagging assocated transactions with that account

### Types of Wavvy Wallet Accounts

Features that cut across all types of accounts : 

- [x] Import Transactions
- [x] Tag & Categorize Transactions : User can create categories and tags or can use the preset one in the app. Tagging can be done manually or automatically by the API.
- [x] Tag Account : User manually assigns a transaction to any one of their created accounts.
- [x] Copy Paste Transactions : For mpesa messages that aren't received via MPESA texts as well as those who haven't allowed message importation.
- [x] Spending Limits : Allows one to put a limit on the amount they can spend on certain tags and categories. The app notifies them when they are about to reach this limit so that they can regulate their spending.
- [x] Loan Tracking i.e. Tala, M Shwari, Fuliza etc : Allows a user to add a loan entry for a certain paybill/phone number or till number. The app then tracks the related transactions and shows the user their loan payment progress.
- [x] Manual Wallets i.e. cash, bank transactions
- [x] Expense Reminders : A user can set a reminder for recurrent expendiures and can get reminders for when these expenses are due. Once a related transaction is made, the app marks the reminder as done and notifies the user.
- [x] Expense Analytics : The app provides a comprehensive breakdown of expenses made over time as well necessary deductions of it.
