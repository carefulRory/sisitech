# Wavvy Wallet MVP 2.0
##### February 2024

## Background

### The Essence of Credulity in UX Research
Credulity, or the readiness to believe, underscores the critical need for empirical observation and prototype testing in UX research. Inspired by ["How to Think Like a UX Researcher"](https://a.co/d/07yoEVD), we emphasize two methodologies for garnering insights:

1. **Observation of Current Solutions:** Engaging directly or indirectly with users to understand their interactions with existing solutions, revealing user behaviors, pain points, and adaptations.
2. **Future Simulation through Prototyping:** Utilizing prototypes to predict and refine how users interact with future product versions, facilitating usability feedback and feature enhancements.

## Market Insight
Kenya's mobile money ecosystem, dominated by Safaricom's M-Pesa with a 95% market share among 77 million accounts, reflects a ripe environment for innovation. This backdrop supports Wavvy Wallet's entry and potential growth in enhancing mobile money management.
