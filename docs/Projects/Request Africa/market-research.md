# Request Africa Features

Request Africa is a music discovery solution that uses an algorithm to listen to radio stations and download the songs played to YouTube. The discoveries are displayed on a dashboard as playlists and can be filtered by top 100 songs played in different radio stations and regions. Users can also get a list of songs similar to songs they like. They can then download the music and add it to their sets.

Request Africa has a number of unfair advantages over its competitors, including a proprietary algorithm, a team of experienced music industry professionals, and a strong network of partnerships. The company will be marketed through a variety of channels, including online advertising, social media marketing, public relations, content marketing, and partnerships with radio stations, record labels, and booking agencies.

Request Africa's target customer segments are DJs, avid music fans, musicians and record labels, booking agencies, marketing agencies, and NGOs/iNGOs. The company's early adopters are likely to be DJs and avid music fans.

## Challenges

 It's essential to consider any legal or ethical implications. 

### Licensing:

- This refers to obtaining permissions to access and use the content broadcasted by radio stations. Even if you're just "listening" and collecting data without actually redistributing or rebroadcasting, you're still using copyrighted content to build and offer a commercial service. Depending on the jurisdiction, this may necessitate a licensing agreement.

### Partnerships:

- Partnering with radio stations can provide mutual benefits. Radio stations may benefit from insights you generate, which can help them better understand their audiences. This could be valuable for them in terms of programming, advertising, etc.

- Partnering can also facilitate access to cleaner, direct audio feeds, ensuring the algorithm's accuracy.

- Collaborative marketing efforts can be employed, promoting both the radio station and your service to a broader audience.

### Downloading from YouTube & Legal Implications:

YouTube's terms of service prohibit downloading their content without permission unless a download button or link is clearly provided by YouTube. Here's what you need to consider:

### Fingerprint, Insights, and Metadata Collection:

Even if you're only downloading for the purpose of data collection and not for redistribution, you're still accessing and using copyrighted content. This would likely be a violation of YouTube's terms of service and potentially copyright law, depending on the jurisdiction.

### Research and Backup:

Even if the intent is purely research, it's important to note that "intent" might not absolve legal responsibility. When it comes to copyrighted content, permissions or licenses are often required, regardless of intent.
