# Overview

- Welcome to [Sisitech MyTables](https://github.com/sisitech/mytables/pkgs/npm/tables), your go-to library for simplifying data display in web development. 
- Sisitech Tables allows developers and engineers to structure data such as text, images, links etc into rows and columns. The point of a table is that it is rigid. Information is easily interpreted by making visual associations between row and column headers.
- When implemented correctly, HTML tables are handled well by accessibility tools such as screen readers, so a successful HTML table should enhance the experience of sighted and visually impaired users alike.
